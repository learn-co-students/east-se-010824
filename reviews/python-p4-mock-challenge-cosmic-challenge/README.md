# Flask Mock Challenge - Cosmic Travel

It is the year 2100 and you run an interplanetary space travel agency. You are
building a website to book scientists on missions to other planets.

In this repo:

- There is a Flask application with some features built out.
- There is a fully built React frontend application.
- There are tests included which you can run using `pytest -x`.
- There is a file `mock-challenge-cosmic-challenge.postman_collection.json` that
  contains a Postman collection of requests for testing each route you will
  implement.

Depending on your preference, you can either check your API by:

- Using Postman to make requests
- Running `pytest -x` and seeing if your code passes the tests
- Running the React application in the browser and interacting with the API via
  the frontend

You can import `mock-challenge-cosmic-challenge.postman_collection.json` into
Postman by pressing the `Import` button.

![import postman](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/6130/phase4-mock-challenge/domain.png)

Select `Upload Files`, navigate to this repo folder, and select
`mock-challenge-cosmic-challenge.postman_collection.json` as the file to import.

## Setup

To download the dependencies for the frontend and backend, run:

```console
pipenv install
pipenv shell
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run your Flask API on [`localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555) by
running:

```console
python server/app.py
```

You can run your React app on [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) by
running:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```

You are not being assessed on React, and you don't have to update any of the
React code; the frontend code is available just so that you can test out the
behavior of your API in a realistic setting.

Your job is to build out the Flask API to add the functionality described in the
deliverables below.

## Models

It is your job to build out Planet, Scientist, and Mission models so that
scientists can book their missions. **In a given mission, one scientist will
visit one planet**. Over their careers, **scientists will visit many planets**
and **planets will be visited by many scientists**.

You will implement an API for the following data model:

![cosmic_model](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/6130/phase4-mock-challenge/domain.png)

The file `server/models.py` defines the model classes **without relationships**.
Use the following commands to create the initial database `app.db`:

```console
cd server
flask db init
flask db migrate -m 'initial model'
flask db upgrade head
```

Now you can implement the relationships as shown in the ER Diagram:

- A `Scientist` has (visits) many `Planets` through `Mission`s
- An `Planet` has (is visited by) many `Scientist`s through `Mission`s
- A `Mission` belongs to a `Scientist` and belongs to a `Planet`

Update `server/models.py` to establish the model relationships. Since a
`Mission` belongs to a `Scientist` and a `Planet`, configure the model to
cascade deletes.

Set serialization rules to limit the recursion depth.

Run the migrations and seed the database:

```console
flask db migrate -m 'implement relationships'
flask db upgrade head
python seed.py
```

> If you aren't able to get the provided seed file working, you are welcome to
> generate your own seed data to test the application.

## Validations

Add validations to the `Scientist` model:

- must have a `name`, and a `field_of_study`

Add validations to the `Mission` model:

- must have a `name`, a `scientist_id` and a `planet_id`

## Routes

Set up the following routes. Make sure to return JSON data in the format
specified along with the appropriate HTTP verb.

Recall you can specify fields to include or exclude when serializing a model
instance to a dictionary using to_dict() (don't forget the comma if specifying a
single field).

NOTE: If you choose to implement a Flask-RESTful app, you need to add code to
instantiate the `Api` class in server/app.py.

### GET /scientists

Return JSON data in the format below. **Note**: you should return a JSON
response in this format, without any additional nested data related to each
scientist.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mel T. Valent",
    "field_of_study": "xenobiology"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "P. Legrange",
    "field_of_study": "orbital mechanics"
  }
]
```

### GET /scientists/<int:id>

If the `Scientist` exists, return JSON data in the format below. Make sure to
include a list of missions for the scientist.

```json
"field_of_study": "Orbits",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Joseph Richard",
    "missions": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Explore Planet X.",
            "planet": {
                "distance_from_earth": 302613474,
                "id": 8,
                "name": "X",
                "nearest_star": "Shiny Star"
            },
            "planet_id": 8,
            "scientist_id": 1
        },
        {
            "id": 10,
            "name": "Explore Planet Y.",
            "planet": {
                "distance_from_earth": 1735242898,
                "id": 14,
                "name": "Y",
                "nearest_star": "Dim Star"
            },
            "planet_id": 14,
            "scientist_id": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

If the `Scientist` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Scientist not found"
}
```

### POST /scientists

This route should create a new `Scientist`. It should accept an object with the
following properties in the body of the request:

```json
{
  "name": "Evan Horizon",
  "field_of_study": "astronavigation"
}
```

If the `Scientist` is created successfully, send back a response with the new
`Scientist`:

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Evan Horizon",
  "field_of_study": "astronavigation",
  "missions": []
}
```

If the `Scientist` is **not** created successfully due to validation errors,
return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

### PATCH /scientists/:id

This route should update an existing `Scientist`. It should accept an object
with one or more of the following properties in the body of the request:

```json
{
  "name": "Bevan Horizon",
  "field_of_study": "warp drive tech"
}
```

If the `Scientist` is updated successfully, send back a response with the
updated `Scientist` and a 202 `accepted` status code:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Bevan Horizon",
  "field_of_study": "warp drive tech",
  "missions": []
}
```

If the `Scientist` is **not** updated successfully, return the following JSON
data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

OR, given an invalid ID, the appropriate HTTP status code, and the following
JSON:

```json
{
  "error": "Scientist not found"
}
```

### DELETE /scientists/<int:id>

If the `Scientist` exists, it should be removed from the database, along with
any `Mission`s that are associated with it. If you did not set up your models to
cascade deletes, you need to delete associated `Mission`s before the `Scientist`
can be deleted.

After deleting the `Scientist`, return an _empty_ response body, along with the
appropriate HTTP status code.

If the `Scientist` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "error": "Scientist not found"
}
```

### GET /planets

Return JSON data in the format below. **Note**: you should return a JSON
response in this format, without any additional nested data related to each
planet.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "TauCeti E",
    "distance_from_earth": 1234567,
    "nearest_star": "TauCeti"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Maxxor",
    "distance_from_earth": 99887766,
    "nearest_star": "Canus Minor"
  }
]
```

### POST /missions

This route should create a new `Missions`. It should accept an object with the
following properties in the body of the request:

```json
{
  "name": "Project Terraform",
  "scientist_id": 1,
  "planet_id": 2
}
```

If the `Mission` is created successfully, send back a response about the new
mission:

```json
{
  "id": 21,
  "name": "Project Terraform",
  "planet": {
    "distance_from_earth": 9037395591,
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Planet X",
    "nearest_star": "Krystal"
  },
  "planet_id": 2,
  "scientist": {
    "field_of_study": "Time travel.",
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Jeremy Oconnor"
  },
  "scientist_id": 1

If the `Mission` is **not** created successfully, return the following JSON
data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```json
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}
```

### (Optional FYI) React `useCallback` hook

The `ScientistDetail` component in the React app uses the `useCallback` hook to
memoize the function that fetches a scientist by id. The scientist detail is
fetched when the component initially renders, and is fetched again after
updating the scientist detail. `useCallback` caches the function to avoid
recreating it .
